In this readme file, we will be looking into how to build a case which hosts our arcade machine. 

# Why do we choose an arcade to be our platform

We have been asking ourselves lots of similar questions, and let me try to address each of them seperately in this section

1.	Why would you build an arcade while the entire game can be developed with PICO-8 on standard OS and laptop?
> Great question. It is certainly true that qiskit can be executed on an averaged laptop, but we are aiming at quantum educations for K-12 students who might not have budgets to own a laptop. Based on our current estimate, the overall cost of a quantum arcade can be controlled within $300 USD, which is comparable to a cheap laptop but has many other features come with raspberry pi can be used in future information science school projects. Also, when playing games we always preferred joystick over arrow keys on the keyboard, isnâ€™t it?

2. There are plenty of arcade machine tutorials showing us how to build an tabletop arcade machine, so why do we want to build our own?

> Well we are building an arcade machine for quantum developers, and it's perhaps most
